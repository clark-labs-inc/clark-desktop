# Clark Code evaluations, benchmarks, and simulations

Last source-and-artifact audit: 2026-08-16.

This catalog covers Clark Code's deterministic open-source checks. Hosted or
paid provider runs are opt-in and require explicit authorization.

## Evidence rules

1. Unit and integration tests prove only their named contracts.
2. Scripted simulations prove harness mechanics, not model quality or live use.
3. Live provider tests require explicit authorization for the exact model and
   route; no live provider test is part of the default gate.
4. Host checks do not prove a packaged application or guest-VM journey.
5. Ignored `target/` and disposable `/tmp` artifacts are not durable evidence.
6. Keep typed receipts and first failures; never infer success from UI state or
   a process exit alone.

## Current map

| Surface | Entrypoint | Evidence class | Claim boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native integrations / read-only iMessage tool | `cargo nextest run -p desktop-integrations -p exec-sandbox`; provider-local `native_data_stays_private_even_with_full_access_file_tools_and_symlinks`; host `renderer_cannot_add_write_or_widen_read_arguments`; frontend `integrations.spec.ts` | deterministic registry, ToolPack schema, synthetic read-only SQLite, real macOS sandbox process, and IPC contracts | Compiled in debug and release profiles. Proves exact-selection and task-scope contracts plus sandboxed file boundaries. It does not prove full host isolation, actual privacy grant/revocation, a live Messages read, or a packaged release. See the retained conclusion below and `crates/desktop-integrations/README.md`. |
| Open-source boundary | `node --test harness/product-boundary.spec.mjs` | deterministic repository-wide text, dependency, and metadata contract | Rejects hardcoded hosted-service policy, commercial access rules, release credentials, and deployment-specific transports |
| Core domain and providers | `cargo nextest run -p agent-core -p provider-acp -p provider-local` with cargo-nextest `0.9.143` | deterministic Rust contracts | Proves provider-neutral projection, ACP translation, and local loop/tool behavior |
| Full deterministic Rust workspace CI | `cargo nextest run --workspace -E 'not test(attachment_benchmark_local)' --no-fail-fast` with cargo-nextest `0.9.143` | deterministic Rust unit, integration, native-host, sandbox, Scout, worker, orchestration, and computer-use contracts | Required on every push and pull request; the host-load-sensitive attachment benchmark remains in the benchmark lane rather than making integration CI timing-dependent |
| Root-loop termination | provider-local `productive_turn_runs_past_128_model_tool_iterations_without_global_cap`, `provider_owns_stream_silence_and_the_user_can_still_cancel`, and agent-orchestration `root_recovery_has_no_implicit_attempt_ceiling` | deterministic provider-loop contracts | Proves productive root work has no implicit step, cumulative-token, stream-idle, wall-clock, empty-outcome, or recovery-attempt lifetime stop; user cancellation remains immediate |
| Provider progress streaming | provider-local `required_tool_contract_violation_gets_one_isolated_repair`, `desktop_sink_announces_an_ordinary_tool_while_arguments_stream`, and the `agent_adapter::tool_call_stream` / `agent_adapter::streaming_tool_call` unit contracts | deterministic provider-stream and desktop-projection contracts | Proves typed reasoning remains visible while required-tool prose is quarantined, ordinary provider tool-call deltas create a pending human-readable row before execution, fragmented tool names are preserved, and a premature `final_answer` payload remains staged behind effect completion. It does not prove a deployed gateway route, a live hosted model, or packaged WebView rendering. |
| Provider reasoning continuity | provider-local reasoning receipt, retry, accumulator, and full-history translation contracts; downstream ignored `live_reasoning_continuity` | deterministic hash-only capture/replay contracts plus an explicitly authorized live Clark Code source-path sample | The focused deterministic gate passed 19/19 (nextest `db3fb4d3-5a49-4666-b347-995846f82e4e`). The 2026-08-26 Ox Alpha sample passed 2/2 turns after four provider responses, retained exact structured reasoning across the full canonical history, and matched capture to replay at SHA-256 `78cc3a2d6c33dcb467b61dec4a5ea0c8d3c275205b42518de8b076119a3b344f`; safe traces contain hashes and counts, never raw private reasoning. Receipt: `/Users/stan/Documents/evals/clark-client-shape-reasoning-20260826_045507/clark-code/clark-code-summary.json`. This proves the current source path, not a packaged or released Clark Code build. |
| Delegated-run lifecycle | agent-orchestration `unbounded_provider_harness_remains_cancellable_while_the_stream_is_idle` and `default_budget_accounts_without_imposing_a_lifetime_ceiling`, plus provider-local `production_harness_path_is_parallel_isolated_reviewed_and_replayed` | deterministic child-provider and isolated-worktree contracts | Productive local, ACP, writer, reviewer, and integrator attempts have no foundation-owned response deadline or default shared-token lifetime ceiling; explicit cancellation wakes an idle stream and reaches the provider. Optional caller-owned deadlines and budgets remain available for bounded tests, evals, and brokered services. This does not prove live delegated-model quality. |
| Tool-result retention | provider-local `giant_tool_output_is_preserved_before_the_next_model_call` plus sibling `../clark-agent` `clips_old_results_but_preserves_the_entire_fresh_batch`, `useful_excerpt_keeps_head_and_tail_within_cap`, and `bounded_excerpt_never_exceeds_a_tiny_cap` | deterministic provider-loop and history-transform contracts | Proves every result in the newest tool-call batch reaches the next model request verbatim, while oversized results from earlier batches retain bounded head/tail evidence with the middle omitted; it does not prove a live provider accepts an arbitrarily large request |
| Awaited background recovery | `env -u RUSTC_WRAPPER cargo nextest run -p provider-local eval_awaited_build_survives_provider_outage_without_keep_going` | deterministic real provider-loop simulation with local shell execution and a scripted SSE outage | Proves one user prompt can start a background build, time out while awaiting it, exhaust request-local transport retries, consume exactly one terminal build receipt during whole-run recovery, and finish with a typed `Done` outcome. Retained 2026-08-14 receipt: nextest `ec4649e9-ad89-4403-b8eb-f5a8b5eabf85`, 1/1 passed in 3.692s. It does not prove a live provider, packaged app, or deployed product. |
| Public live benchmark interface | sibling `../clark-public-evals` package, with Clark Managed and the downstream Clark Code public CLI as separate targets | externally owned, opt-in Free-tier live evaluation | Routes Finance Agent v2, Terminal-Bench, DeepSWE, BrowseComp, WebTailBench, Online-Mind2Web, and OSWorld-Verified without importing branded policy into this foundation. Scores and release claims belong to the external package and downstream Clark release; this repository owns only the provider contracts they exercise. |
| Full-stack worker simulation | `cargo nextest run -p code-worker --test full_stack_simulation` | deterministic end-to-end simulation: the real `agent-code-worker` binary over its real stdio JSONL protocol, the real provider-local loop against a scripted loopback OpenAI-SSE model, real tools in a real temporary Git repository | Proves the seam no per-crate contract covers: boot receipt with execution residency, bounded `fs/walk` truncation, path confinement without content leakage, a streamed multi-turn run whose permission gate is answered over the wire mid-stream, files really written and a checkpoint ref really created, tool results round-tripped to the model, monotone progress sequences with exactly one run start/finish, terminal frames without embedded snapshots, mid-run cancellation as a typed terminal with the session surviving, SIGKILL + restart replaying a byte-identical durable receipt, same-id/different-params as `request_id_conflict`, stale sessions as typed `invalid_input`, health pings answered and extra work refused `busy` on a saturated single-permit worker, an oversized request line surviving as `request_too_large`, and clean shutdown. It does not prove SSH transport, live-model quality, or the packaged WebView. First run discovered and fixed the host collapsing every non-cancel plugin error into `plugin_failed`; caller errors are now typed (`invalid_input`, `unknown_plugin`, `unsupported_operation`) on the wire. |
| Native host | `cargo nextest run -p desktop-foundation --lib` | deterministic native command contracts | A packaged application still requires platform verification |
| Cloud auth refresh replay | desktop-foundation `expired_token_refreshes_and_replays_the_durable_outbox_end_to_end`; frontend `productBridge.spec.ts`, `sessionStore.cloudLifecycle.spec.ts`, `authPersistence.spec.ts`, `useProductAccess.spec.ts`, `specialists.readRoots.spec.ts`, and `SpecialistAccessGate.spec.ts` | deterministic native-host simulation with real SQLite and local HTTP transport plus renderer request/recovery and access-state contracts | Proves an expired bearer produces one auth-refresh event, a delayed same-account credential generation wakes native delivery, and the byte-equivalent logical batch retries durably; renderer product calls join one refresh flight, wait for native-event recovery, replay the exact rejected operation at most once, publish only the still-active account, preserve auth-cache ownership, fence stale access results across account switches, make refresh failure manually reconnectable, and replace an indeterminate Security access check with an explicit retry state. It does not prove the packaged WebView, deployed gateway, or live identity provider. |
| Update/relaunch conversation durability | frontend `cloudHistory.spec.ts`, `cloudArtifacts.spec.ts`, and `sessionStore.updater.spec.ts`; desktop-foundation outbox `newer_pending_snapshot_survives_a_superseded_publication_ack`, `pending_snapshot_is_not_discarded_when_an_uncertain_put_advanced_cloud_revision`, and `staged_artifact_bytes_and_upload_receipt_survive_database_reopen` | deterministic renderer/native integration and real FULL-synchronous SQLite reopen contracts | Proves the updater gates on native durability rather than cloud latency; the newest coalesced tail can commit while an older cloud PUT remains unresolved; a late acknowledgement is mutation-fenced in the same transaction and cannot overwrite or clear the newer durable snapshot; pending snapshots retain their mutation identity through reopen and an uncertain response that advanced cloud revision; generated Markdown bytes and digest-fenced upload receipts survive process death; an idle snapshot revalidates an in-place rewrite, and neither an older upload nor a replaced SHA can acknowledge the newer bytes. Cloud replay, packaged relaunch, deployed gateway, and paid-provider behavior remain separate live gates. Retained packaged/live boundary receipt: `docs/testing/2026-08-20-update-relaunch-durability.md`; its package hash predates the atomic-ack cleanup, whose exact source currently has deterministic coverage only. |
| WASM core | `cargo check -p agent-core --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` | compile contract | Proves the domain crate remains WASM-clean |
| Frontend | `pnpm --dir app typecheck`, `pnpm --dir app test`, `pnpm --dir app build` | deterministic TypeScript, component, and bundle contracts | Proves the checked Clark Code frontend bundle |
| Queued follow-up steering | frontend `sessionStore.steer.spec.ts`; native host `adjacent_user_prompts_remain_distinct_after_replay` | deterministic renderer/session and durable projection contracts | Proves explicit steering cancels the current run while retaining the message in the ordinary follow-up queue, so the existing idle drain sends it once instead of hiding it in a provider-owned mid-run queue; every accepted user turn carries an explicit message boundary, so adjacent prompts remain separate through live projection and durable replay. It does not prove packaged cancellation latency or live-model behavior. |
| Hyper-realistic recovery matrix | `pnpm --dir app test -- src/core-bridge/resilienceBenchmark.spec.ts` plus `pnpm --dir harness test:resilience` | deterministic nine-fault power set (512 combinations) plus representative Chromium product journeys | Proves typed rate-limit, timeout, upstream, duplicate-tool-id, event-stream, tool-host, provider-process, cloud-sync, and user-cancel combinations settle truthfully; recovered incidents stay out of product UI, terminal interruption offers resume, cancellation requires an explicit stop, and raw diagnostics do not leak. It does not prove a live provider or packaged WebView. |
| Specialist runtime matrix | `pnpm --dir harness test:specialists` | deterministic Chromium integration against a product composition and mock-provider boundary, with typed receipts and transition screenshots | Discovers the public fixture's Scout, Security, and RSI catalog; for each it proves access-ready and subscription-gated states, all starter/example/canvas tabs, failed-start draft recovery, optimistic/running/commentary/typed-presentation/final settlement, exact skill or research-runtime routing, organization/company/repository authority, terminal store projection, detach/reattach continuity, and mobile chat/canvas reachability without horizontal overflow. This matrix does not prove hosted-model quality, live entitlement/cloud services, the packaged WebView, or native platform behavior. |
| Model picker UI | `node harness/model-picker-smoke.mjs` | deterministic browser-bound UI-only interaction with screenshot and typed receipt | Proves the composer model menu is portaled above the workspace, stays inside a compact viewport, and accepts pointer selection in both directions; packaged native WebKit behavior remains a separate platform receipt |
| SSH execution-target picker | `node harness/ssh-settings-smoke.mjs` | deterministic browser-bound UI-only interaction with SSH discovery/probe fixtures, screenshots, and a typed receipt | Proves a host can be saved before choosing its default folder, an add-host action from the composer selects that exact host as the remote execution target, and incomplete targets remain actionable without a premature Git connection; live SSH and packaged native behavior remain separate receipts |
| Pragmatic drag and drop UI | `node harness/pragmatic-dnd-smoke.mjs` | deterministic browser-bound UI-only interaction with screenshot and typed receipt | Proves pinned-project pointer reordering, the equivalent exact-position menu with focus restoration, desktop-file drop attachment, and the equivalent file picker; packaged native WebKit/OS drag behavior remains a separate platform receipt |
| Artifact delivery UI | `node harness/artifact-delivery-smoke.mjs` | deterministic browser-bound mock-provider journey with screenshot and download receipts | Proves inline image decoding, real PDF page rendering, visible artifact actions, image/PDF save-copy delivery, and artifact-workspace rendering; packaged native save dialogs remain a separate platform receipt |
| Attachment composer UI | `node harness/attachment-smoke.mjs` | deterministic WebKit mock-provider journey with delayed attachment admission and a typed receipt | Proves image and large-paste staging, immediate atomic composer clearing, non-repeatable sending feedback, expanded-paste delivery, and settled admission; packaged native attachment delivery and upload timing remain separate platform receipts |
| Cloud composer drafts | `pnpm --dir app test -- cloudComposerDraft.network.spec.ts cloudComposerDraft.spec.ts layoutPolicy.spec.ts composerDraft.spec.ts sessionStore.composerDraft.spec.ts`; downstream `cargo nextest run -p conversation-cloud`; `CLARK_REQUIRE_DESKTOP_DRAFT_DB=1 cargo nextest run -p clark-service-db --test desktop_draft_cas_e2e`; and `CLARK_REQUIRE_DESKTOP_DRAFT_DB=1 cargo nextest run -p clark-services --test desktop_draft_http_e2e` | deterministic frontend state-machine and native HTTP-codec checks plus real Axum/auth/Postgres CAS | Proves scoped keys, authoritative 204-to-revision-zero handling, conditional accepted-text clearing, bounded typed conflict handling, specialist-key URL encoding, create/update/payload-stable mutation replay/idempotent-clear/stale/concurrent CAS behavior, and authenticated HTTP response shapes; it does not prove the repaired service is deployed |
| Size-independent transcript history | `pnpm --dir app test`; `CLARK_LARGE_TRANSCRIPT_PERF=1 pnpm --dir app vitest run src/lib/transcriptPaging.perf.spec.ts --testTimeout=120000 --reporter=verbose`; downstream Postgres/page/client checks | deterministic immutable-page, bounded-renderer, native-IPC, HTTP/SQL batching, redaction, and logical-wire-volume contracts | The 2026-08-17 retained local gate archived 100 MiB into 20 pages/5 upload requests in 68 ms with a 35,717,120-byte peak RSS delta, and 1,024 MiB into 205 pages/52 requests in 610 ms with a 4,341,760-byte delta. Both kept the live head at 160 items and the largest request at 20,973,276 bytes. The large fixture shares one 1 MiB payload in memory while forcing its full logical bytes through JSON encoding, so it proves bounded conversion overhead and wire work, not a 1 GiB unique-resident WebView heap, deployed migration, or real WAN throughput. Legacy inline and segmented reads remain supported. |
| Local sandbox | `cargo nextest run -p exec-sandbox` | deterministic policy and platform-adapter contracts | Packaged and signed binaries require a separate platform receipt |
| Durable worker | `cargo nextest run -p code-host -p code-worker -p code-remote -p provider-remote-worker` with cargo-nextest `0.9.143`, plus the composed product frontend contract | deterministic protocol, confinement, and renderer/native ownership contracts | Remote sessions carry only an opaque worker binding plus bounded typed recipes. The generic worker rejects unregistered product extension ids; downstream compositions may register compile-time session extensions in their own worker binary, while credentials remain native-owned and outside every recipe. Ignored live SSH lanes require explicit authorization |
| Orchestration | provider-local orchestration benchmark tests | deterministic fixture contracts | Does not claim live-model quality |
| Memory and goals | provider-local memory and goal eval tests | deterministic fixture contracts | Live-model quality is separate and opt-in |
| Scout human authority | `pnpm --dir app test -- ComposerContextBar.spec.ts localAgent.spec.ts sessionStore.scoutAuthority.spec.ts sessionStore.scoutStart.spec.ts` | deterministic renderer/session contracts | Proves explicit organization/workspace binding, enterprise-perimeter composer semantics, neutral checkout census roots, and refusal to start or reopen unbound Scout work; it does not prove a live census |
| Scout perimeter discovery | `cargo nextest run -p scout-adapter-runtime --lib` plus provider-local `census_reconciles_transport_equivalent_remotes_without_leaking_paths`, `run_start_result_exposes_the_exact_backend_continuation_ids`, and `model_visible_typed_details_survive_tool_result_translation` | deterministic target-adapter, route-registry, bounded local-checkout, and model-wire contracts | Proves GitHub organization and authenticated-user repository pagination, opaque local checkout identity, bounded manifest inspection, and exact model-visible propagation of backend-issued Scout handles while retaining the same typed UI metadata; it does not prove current live credentials or complete enterprise access |
| Enterprise feature context | `cargo nextest run -p agent-core`, provider-local planning/tool tests, and downstream `cargo check -p clark-services` | deterministic domain, permission, and compile contracts | Proves typed revision pinning, host-scoped bounded reads, and fresh-confirmation feedback wiring; it does not prove deployed graph coverage or production tenancy |

## Native integrations / iMessage — 2026-09-01

The foundation has a compiled native integration registry in Settings →
Integrations and one eager local-provider tool named
`read_imessage_selection`. The tool has no arguments and can return only the
1–20 exact message IDs a user enabled for the bound task after native approval
and conversation selection. Every call rechecks account, task, account
generation, live session instance, 15-minute expiry, sleep/lock epoch, current
OS access, and exact text equality. Tool output labels Messages text as
untrusted quoted data.

No draft, send, Apple Events, Automation permission, send ledger, background
polling, inbound task trigger, or model-selectable conversation/query surface
exists. The adapter is compiled in release builds. No Messages content was
read, no privacy permission was granted, and no hosted model call was made
during implementation checks.

Retained deterministic conclusions:

- Full workspace nextest `10471735-ada7-4131-a8b3-85a05c5812d4`:
  **1,478 passed, 11 skipped**. The focused integration/sandbox run
  `5a36b2a1-0071-4977-a9c6-89a9cc9d863e` passed **27/27**, including the
  fixed argument-free ToolPack schema, no send tool, explicit enablement,
  task/account/generation/session isolation, changed-text and OS-revocation
  failures, read-only synthetic SQLite, and real macOS sandbox read/write
  denial through direct and symlink paths.
- Native IPC `acd332e0-8db2-4565-a5e2-d58889701006` passed **1/1**, rejecting
  send, draft, Automation, owner override, and widened read arguments.
- Frontend passed **815 tests with 5 skipped** across 173 passing and 2 skipped
  files; typecheck and production build passed. Browser previews still refuse
  native integration access instead of simulating Messages.
- Scoped Clippy passed with warnings denied for agent-core, provider-acp,
  provider-local, devbridge, desktop-integrations, and exec-sandbox. The full
  native-host Clippy command remains blocked by 12 warnings in unrelated files;
  they were not modified. Repository formatting, core WASM, product boundary
  **14/14**, native debug compilation, and optimized release compilation all
  passed. Release compilation retained the existing unused
  `TrajectoryOutbox::acknowledge` warning outside this change.
- Local validation uses this checkout's existing `.cargo/config.toml` path
  override for the sibling `clark-agent`. This is not exact pinned-dependency
  CI or a packaged/released product receipt.
- The unsigned `./script/build_and_run.sh` launcher built and started the
  current `target/debug/clark-code`. Startup did not connect iMessage, request
  Full Disk Access, read Messages, use a signing identity, or touch Keychain.

**Isolation limitation:** Full Disk Access belongs to the whole Clark Code app,
not a task or conversation. Sandboxed commands and file tools deny Messages
paths after symlink resolution, but Full Access/elevated execution, MCP,
external agents, terminals, computer use, another same-user process, and a
compromised renderer are not comprehensively contained by this grant. The
read tool itself is task-scoped; the macOS app permission is not. A separately
identified authenticated broker is still required for strong app-level
isolation.

Actual-app permission owner attribution, grant/deny/revoke, a live selected
conversation read through the tool, real sleep/lock/restart, and alternate-tool
isolation remain **not run**. User-assisted acceptance steps and schema limits
are in [`crates/desktop-integrations/README.md`](crates/desktop-integrations/README.md).
Do not promote deterministic receipts into a live iMessage claim.

## Sidebar navigation audit — 2026-09-04

The local foundation sidebar was audited and repaired in the Codex in-app browser
using disposable projects and the mock bridge. The retained [audit and screenshots](docs/sidebar-audit/README.md)
record folder-based session creation, visible project/conversation actions,
explicit rename, keyboard menu navigation and focus return, archive/search/restore,
and a dismissible narrow-window navigation drawer. Search indexes project paths
and aliases; archived matches appear in the search region. Empty specialist
catalogs no longer expose an empty disclosure.

Frontend typecheck, production build, and the full deterministic frontend suite
passed (835 passed, 5 skipped). These checks and the recorded browser interactions
do not prove a packaged native build, OS folder picker, live SSH, paid providers,
full accessibility compliance, or branded specialist/account flows. Failure and
pending-start cancellation handling in the chooser was reviewed in source, not
fault-injected in the browser.

Browser-preview Quick Chat follow-up: `mockBridge.sidebar.spec.ts` now verifies
that default-generated workspace IDs are distinct UUIDs and that two new Quick
Chats form one `quick-chats` sidebar group. The three focused mock-sidebar tests
and frontend typecheck passed. This corrects preview IDs only; it does not migrate
previously created `mock-workspace-*` fixture history or change native workspaces.

Additional sidebar papercuts (same audit): `sidebarProjectTarget.spec.ts` pins
exact remote-project folder selection even when a saved host's default changed,
and search text matching the visible Quick chats and project-alias labels.
`newProjectDialog.spec.ts` pins retention of an edited or cleared folder when
saved hosts refresh. `hotkeys.spec.ts` pins consumed-event ownership and rejects
modal Tab navigation as a background global shortcut. The folder chooser also
filters hidden controls from its focus loop and includes disclosure summaries.

In-app browser checks confirmed Quick chats search, Quick Chat composer focus,
Command-backslash opening the narrow-window drawer, and reverse/forward Tab
wrapping inside the session chooser. The first keyboard check exposed background
Shift-Tab changing approval policy; after the fix, repeated modal Shift-Tab left
Approve for me unchanged. The preview policy was restored before continuing.
A development hot-reload hook-order error during editing was recovered with a
fresh page load; subsequent interactive checks passed. Exact remote-folder and
host-refresh contracts are deterministic checks, not live SSH acceptance.
Final frontend typecheck/build and full suite passed: 843 passed, 5 skipped.

## UI highlighting and motion — 2026-09-05

Syntax highlighting now uses a module worker in browsers. The worker loads
language grammars on demand; the production worker entry is about 190 kB
uncompressed rather than an inline bundle of all grammars. Browser callers
share duplicate requests, match replies by request identity, and retain plain
code if worker initialization, messaging, or a 15-second request deadline fails.
The existing source-identity guard still prevents stale highlighted markup from
covering a replacement code fence. Server-side rendering uses the same engine
without a worker.

Validation on the current working tree: frontend typecheck/build and 847 tests
passed (5 skipped). `highlight.worker.spec.ts` covers duplicate and out-of-order
requests, separate line/block output, worker failure, and stalled requests.
`node harness/highlight-staleness-probe.mjs` passed in Chromium and with
`ENGINE=webkit` in the WebKit proxy. The cold-worker step waits for actual
highlighted output, bounded at 15 seconds, instead of assuming a 900 ms load.

The two 12-turn Chromium streaming probes (301 snapshot pushes each) retained
under `target/perf/20260905T075115Z-ad5abaee-streamA1-chromium` and
`target/perf/20260905T075346Z-ad5abaee-streamA1-chromium` provide local attribution:
Shiki regex tokenization appeared in the first main-thread profile and left the
main-thread leaderboard after worker isolation. Both runs failed machine
quiescence and used Vite development mode plus a profiler. Their timing and
frame-loss figures are not authoritative performance baselines; the disposable
traces are not release evidence. Controlled packaged-native timing remains
unmeasured; navigation/streaming acceptance is recorded below.

Navigation acceptance on 2026-09-05: `node harness/workspace-motion.mjs`
passed in Chromium and WebKit, each with normal and reduced motion. It proves
stable workspace-node identity across chat switches, per-conversation draft
separation, preserved draft/focus during a streaming update, no repeated
navigation animation on that update, no blank-opacity navigation phase, and
settings scroll reset. Normal navigation uses the shared 200 ms transform cue;
reduced motion uses a 120 ms opacity cue. These are deterministic browser
fixtures, not hosted-model or cross-platform packaged-release receipts.

`./script/build_and_run.sh` compiled and launched the unsigned native debug
application successfully in 28.67 seconds, and the WebView loaded the frontend.
This is native startup evidence, not a measured native interaction benchmark.

Final regression checks for this UI change: frontend typecheck, production
build, 847 frontend tests (5 skipped), Rust formatting, Clippy for the four
foundation crates, 816 nextest tests (8 skipped), and the agent-core WASM
compile check passed. No hosted-provider calls or release deployment were run.


## Autoregressive prompt and tool audit — 2026-09-05

Scope: foundation system and per-turn prompt assembly, steering, local tool
schemas, computer-action schemas, delegated review receipts, and the local
schema-to-wire adapter. The audit inspected existing planning, file-edit,
memory, image, device, and deferred-tool ordering as well. Product-owned
prompt overrides and third-party MCP schema authorship are outside this result.

The governing rule is dependency order: generate the concrete inputs needed
for a judgment before its verdict, and receive a tool result before generating
arguments that depend on it. This is distinct from sorting every field as
"rationale first" or "action first". Schema order guides model generation;
it does not enforce JSON output order or establish correctness.

| Finding | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `verify_effect` chose status before read-back evidence and comparison values | `effect_id → evidence → expected → observed → status` |
| Delegated review resolution chose accept/rework before feedback | Nested decisions now use `task_id → feedback → decision` |
| Enterprise feedback chose outcome before evidence and summary | `evidence_refs → summary → outcome` |
| Final delivery composed prose before enumerating deliverables | `files → content`; files remain optional and independently validated |
| All eight computer-action preparation schemas classified risk before selecting the observed target and action | Observed application/window identity and action arguments precede reason and advisory risk; trusted backend classification is unchanged |
| PoC generation selected its success exit code after writing the script | Expected observation and expected exit code precede script |
| In-flight steering appended attached text after the user's request | Attachments precede the explicit final user-request block, matching ordinary turn assembly |
| System communication rules did not state the cross-call generation dependency | Independent batching is explicit; dependent arguments wait for a subsequent model turn containing the prerequisite result; effect verification instructions precede completion instructions |
| Implementation guidance forced an edit after eight inspection calls | Edits follow inspection of the target, existing contract, and required dependencies; no arbitrary read quota forces premature implementation |

Preserved: field names, required-field membership, invocation parsing, runtime
permissions, approval requirements, and effect/delivery validation. The optional
feedback and artifact fields remain optional, so order alone cannot compel
evidence disclosure. Existing edit locate-before-payload and planning
contract-before-prose rules remain. MCP schemas are passed through unchanged;
we do not alphabetize or rewrite third-party contracts. The adapter clones
schema parameters into the model request.

Regression coverage now checks actual serialized `properties` keys rather than
searching the entire schema text, which could accidentally match descriptions
or `required` entries. Existing prompt and schema tests were moved into separate
modules to keep source files below the repository's size thresholds.

Validation on the current local source:

- Nextest `88a3484d-bf10-417a-9735-23b43bd35739`: **819 passed, 8 skipped**
  across agent-core, provider-acp, and provider-local. Includes schema order,
  nested review ordering, steering attachment order, prompt dependency order,
  computer actions, and existing effect/delivery contracts.
- Workspace formatting check passed. Required clippy gate passed for agent-core, provider-acp, provider-local,
  and devbridge; agent-core WASM check passed.
- Frontend frozen install, typecheck, **847 tests passed / 5 skipped**, and
  production build passed.
- The unsigned `./script/build_and_run.sh` path built and launched `clark-code`
  successfully. No hosted conversation or visual UI qualification was performed.
- These checks use the existing local Cargo configuration, which redirects the
  pinned agent dependency to the sibling checkout. They are not a clean CI or
  packaged-release qualification.

No hosted-model calls were made. Improved live-model reliability, provider-side
schema ordering, and behavioral effect sizes remain unmeasured.
